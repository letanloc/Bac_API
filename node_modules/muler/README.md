# Muler

Muler is a lightweight command line tool used for maintaining your mmc server api. So no need to login from a browser.

Currently you can do below things by muler.
1. Login into a MMC server
2. List all the Servers and Clusters
3. List all the applications in a Server/Cluster
4. List all the deployments in a Server/Cluster
5. Deploy an application into repository
6. Start and restart an application

Below are upcoming futures into muler.
1. Save configurations and use them in command line
2. More options 


Muler is built on **prompt** for user interaction and **bcrypt** for encrypting user information.
